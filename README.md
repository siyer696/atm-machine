## Troubleshooting ROR Installation

These are the workarounds I used to troubleshoot ROR Installation. Hope this helps you.

1. Upgrade apt
``` bash
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
2. If you get install <=1 version yarn warning during execution of rails server, you can perform following steps
```bash
curl --compressed -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
```

3. If you get webpacker error, re-install using the following command
```bash
rails webpacker:install
```

## Installation

The easiest way to install Newman is using NPM. If you have Node.js installed, it is most likely that you have NPM installed as well.

```bash
npm install -g newman
```

This installs Newman globally on your system allowing you to run it from anywhere. If you want to install it locally, Just remove the `-g` flag.

To generate reports in HTML, you need to install another npm package.

```bash
npm install -g newman-reporter-htmlextra
```
